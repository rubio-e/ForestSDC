#' ForestSDC: Forest stand Structure, tree Diversity and species Composittion.
#'
#' The `ForestSDC` package is a comprehensive tool set for analyzing data from forest inventories
#' and permanent research plots. It includes functions to estimate structural indices,
#' biodiversity metrics, and the nearest neighbor summary statistics.
#' These tools are essential for assessing forest dynamics, biodiversity, and ecosystem health.
#'
#' Key features include:
#' - Structural indices such as Shannon's diversity, Simpson's complement, and species richness.
#' - Spatial analysis using nearest-neighbor methods.
#' - Customizable tools for biodiversity and forest dynamics evaluation.
#'
#' The package leverages `dplyr` and `tidyr` for data manipulation and `FNN` for efficient
#' nearest-neighbor calculations.
