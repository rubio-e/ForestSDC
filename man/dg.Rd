\title{Calculate Quadratic Mean Diameter (QMD)}
\usage{
dg(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector. A vector of tree diameters (in centimeters).}
}
\value{
Numeric. The quadratic mean diameter (in centimeters).
}
\description{
This function calculates the quadratic mean diameter (QMD) of a set of tree diameters.
The QMD is a commonly used forestry measure to assess the average tree diameter
in a stand, weighted by the basal area of the trees. It is useful for understanding
stand structure and growth.
}
\details{
The formula used is:
\deqn{QMD = \sqrt{\frac{\sum BA}{k \times n}}}
where:
- \eqn{\sum BA} is the sum of the basal areas of all trees.
- \eqn{k} is a constant factor for conversion.
- \eqn{n} is the number of trees.
}
\examples{
# Example tree diameters
x <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 25, 30, 22, 11, 10)
