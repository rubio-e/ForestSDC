\title{BALMOD Competition Index}
\usage{
BALMOD(x, y, z)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector representing the diameters of the trees in cm.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector representing the heights of the trees in meters.}

\item{z}{A numeric variable representing the plot area in square meters.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing the BALMOD index for each tree.
}
\description{
This function calculates the BALMOD competition index for trees based on their
diameters, heights, and the area of the plot. The BALMOD index measures competition
among trees by integrating basal area proportion, relative spacing, and dominant height.
}
\details{
The BALMOD index is computed as:

\deqn{\text{BALMOD} = \frac{1 - \pi}{RS}}

where:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{\pi} is the proportion of the basal area of the individual tree (\eqn{\pi = \frac{\text{BAL}}{G_{\text{ha}}}}),
\item \eqn{RS} is the relative spacing (\eqn{RS = \frac{\sqrt{10000 / N}}{h_{\text{dom}}}}),
\item \eqn{N} is the total number of trees in the plot,
\item \eqn{h_{\text{dom}}} is the dominant height, defined as the mean height of the tallest trees.
}
}
\examples{
x <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 25, 30, 22, 11, 10) # Tree diameters in cm
y <- c(12, 23, 33, 45, 43, 22, 31, 32, 13, 11) # Tree heights in meters
z <- 400 # Plot area in square meters

BALMOD(x, y, z) # Calculate BALMOD index
