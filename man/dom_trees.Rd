\title{Identify Dominant Trees in a Plot Area}
\usage{
dom_trees(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector. A vector of tree diameters measured in centimeters.}

\item{y}{Numeric variable. The total plot area in square meters.}
}
\value{
Character vector. A vector of the same length as `x`, where each entry is labeled
        as "dom_tree" for dominant trees and "not_dom" for non-dominant trees.
}
\description{
This function identifies the dominant trees in a specified plot area by selecting
the 100 thickest trees based on their diameters. Dominant trees are classified
as those whose diameters fall within the top 100 in the given plot area.
}
\examples{
# Example tree diameters
x <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 25, 30, 22, 11, 10)

# Specify the plot area
y <- 1000

# Identify dominant trees
dom_trees(x, y)
