\title{Individual Tree Crown Area}
\usage{
ca(cw_a, cw_b)
}
\arguments{
\item{cw_a}{A numeric variable representing the first tree crown diameter in meters.}

\item{cw_b}{A numeric variable representing the second tree crown diameter in meters.}
}
\value{
A numeric variable representing the tree crown area in square meters.
}
\description{
This function calculates the crown area of an individual tree based on two
measurements of its crown diameters. The crown area is computed using the
average of the two diameters and is assumed to be circular.
}
\examples{
crown_area <- ca(10, 15)
crown_area # Output: Area in square meters

}
